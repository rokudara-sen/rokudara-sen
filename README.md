# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm Matteo, a 21-year-old computer science student passionate about systems programming and cybersecurity. My focus revolves around C#, C++, and C‚Äîlanguages that let me dig into performance optimization, memory management, and the kind of problem-solving that feels like untangling a puzzle. When it comes to IT security, I‚Äôm drawn to the offensive side: penetration testing, vulnerability research, and understanding how systems break (so I can help fix them).  <br><br>Outside of coursework, I‚Äôm sharpening my skills by diving into open-source projects. Right now, I‚Äôm exploring *Space Station 14*‚Äîa complex multiplayer sandbox game‚Äîand working up the courage to submit my first contribution. Game development is another hobby of mine; I experiment with small prototypes to blend coding rigor with creative design, though I‚Äôve learned the hard way that "simple mechanics" are rarely simple.  <br><br>I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me, whether it‚Äôs security tools, open-source software, or systems-level programming. If you‚Äôre building something interesting or just want to geek out about reverse engineering, feel free to reach out. Always happy to learn, share ideas, or brainstorm over a strong cup of espresso.  <br><br>*(Current mission: Finally get that PR merged into Space Station 14. Wish me luck.)*
